What this code does- Home.jsx
  

This is the main React page that controls the flow of your app:

Student fills CareerInputForm (basic info like grades, interests).

Then they complete AssessmentForm (quiz questions).

Finally, backend returns career recommendations, which are shown using CareerRecommendations.

So this component is like the orchestrator of the frontend journey.
