Why we use Ingress
------------------------
Without Ingress:
Each service needs its own NodePort or LoadBalancer to be externally accessible.
This exposes multiple IPs/ports, which is messy and hard to manage.
With Ingress:
Only the Ingress Controller’s Service is exposed externally.
All services inside the cluster are accessed through the controller, using paths or hostnames defined in Ingress rules.
Clients don’t need to know the internal service IPs or NodePorts.


Service Account:
by deafult there is a sa callled default
  from a pod you cannot make API CALLS - actually there is no need for that


 kubectl create rolebinding nginx-sa-readonly \
  --clusterrole=view \
  --serviceaccount=default:nginx-serviceaccount \
  --namespace=default
here cluster role is set to view.
