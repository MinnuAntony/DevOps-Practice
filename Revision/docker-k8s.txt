Relationship between Docker/Container Runtime and Kubernetes
Containers need a runtime to exist
Docker Engine (historically), or now more commonly containerd or CRI-O, is the runtime that actually pulls images, creates containers, and manages their lifecycle.
Without a runtime, there are no containers.
Kubernetes needs a runtime to run workloads
Kubernetes does not run containers itself. It only tells the runtime: “I need a Pod with this container image, these resources, and these configs.”
The kubelet on each node talks to the runtime (via CRI) to make this happen.
They are loosely coupled
Kubernetes is the orchestrator (what to run, where, and how).
The container runtime is the executor (actually runs the container processes).
This loose coupling means Kubernetes is runtime-agnostic: you can swap Docker Engine with containerd or CRI-O, and Kubernetes will still work.
