# Kubernetes Pods: Internal Creation Flow (Deep Dive)

> A practical, end‑to‑end walkthrough of what *actually* happens inside a Kubernetes cluster when you create a Pod (or a Deployment that creates Pods)—from `kubectl apply` to packets hitting your container.

---

## 0) Kubernetes Architecture (quick but complete)

**Control plane (brains)**

* **kube‑apiserver**: Front door; validates requests, runs authn/authz/admission, persists state to etcd, exposes a watch/stream interface to everyone else.
* **etcd**: Strongly consistent, MVCC key‑value store; holds the *desired* and *observed* state of all API objects.
* **kube‑controller‑manager**: A bundle of controllers (Deployment, ReplicaSet, Job, StatefulSet, Node, EndpointSlice, ResourceQuota, etc.). Each runs a reconcile loop: *current vs desired → take actions*.
* **kube‑scheduler**: Assigns Pods without a node to a specific Node based on filters (feasibility) and scores (best fit). Handles preemption when necessary.
* **cloud‑controller‑manager (optional/managed)**: Talks to the cloud provider (e.g., ELB creation, Node lifecycle). In managed services (EKS/GKE/AKS) it’s often provided/hidden.

**Node plane (muscle)**

* **kubelet**: Per‑node agent. Watches the API for Pods bound to its node and drives the container runtime to realize them. Reports status, runs probes, mounts volumes.
* **Container runtime (via CRI)**: Typically containerd or CRI‑O. Creates the Pod sandbox (infra container), pulls images, runs containers, manages cgroups/namespaces.
* **CNI plugin**: Programs pod networking (veth pairs, IPAM, routes/NAT), and enforces NetworkPolicy (iptables/eBPF via Calico, Cilium, etc.).
* **kube‑proxy**: Implements Service VIPs and load‑balancing on each node (iptables or IPVS). Some CNIs replace/augment this.
* **CSI drivers (node + controller pieces)**: Attach/mount/block/ephemeral volumes.

---

## 1) The Request: from your shell to the cluster

1. **You apply YAML** (e.g., a Deployment or a naked Pod):

   * `kubectl` sends a REST call to **kube‑apiserver**.
2. **Authentication** (x509 client cert, bearer token, OIDC/JWT, etc.).
3. **Authorization** (RBAC/ABAC/webhook): are you allowed to create this object?
4. **Admission chain** (ordered):

   * **Mutating** (may change your object): defaults, LimitRanger, sidecar injectors (Istio/Linkerd), PSP replacement (Pod Security Admission defaults), image pull secrets injection, tolerations defaults, etc.
   * **Validating** (must accept): ResourceQuota, PodSecurity Admission (baseline/restricted), custom policy engines (Kyverno/Gatekeeper), topology constraints,
     and any org‑specific validations.
5. **Persistence**: The (possibly mutated) object is written to **etcd** with a new `resourceVersion`.

> If you created a **Deployment**, the Deployment controller immediately ensures a **ReplicaSet**, which then creates **Pod** objects (with `ownerReferences`). From here, the rest of this flow focuses on Pods.

---

## 2) Controller loops kick in (if not a naked Pod)

* **Deployment controller** computes desired ReplicaSets and replica counts.
* **ReplicaSet controller** compares desired vs actual Pods → creates/deletes Pods to match.
* Each created Pod initially has **no `spec.nodeName`** (i.e., unscheduled).

---

## 3) Scheduling: choosing a node

1. **Scheduler watches** the API for unscheduled Pods.
2. **Filter (feasibility)** across candidate nodes:

   * Node readiness/taints & Pod **tolerations**
   * **Resources** (CPU/memory/extended resources, PodOverhead)
   * **Affinity/anti‑affinity** & **topology spread** constraints
   * **Volume feasibility** (PVC binding, CSI capabilities, zone/az constraints)
   * **Node selectors/labels** & RuntimeClass/node features (GPU, SGX, kata, etc.)
3. **Score (ranking)** feasible nodes: balance/pack, affinity weights, image locality, etc.
4. **PreBind** (e.g., finalize volume bindings).
5. **Bind**: Scheduler writes a **Binding** (or sets `spec.nodeName`) → Pod is now assigned to a node.
6. **(Optional) Preemption**: if no feasible nodes, may evict lower‑priority Pods to make room.

An **Event** sequence appears on the Pod (e.g., *Scheduled*), visible via `kubectl describe pod`.

---

## 4) Kubelet turns desired state into containers

On the chosen node, **kubelet** is watching the API and sees the new bound Pod:

1. **Pod sandbox creation** (via CRI):

   * Runtime creates an *infra/pause* container which holds the Pod’s Linux namespaces (net, ipc, uts, pid if ShareProcessNamespace, etc.).
   * **Security** applied: cgroups (QoS classes: Guaranteed/Burstable/BestEffort), seccomp/AppArmor, SELinux, user/group mappings, capabilities, Linux `oom_score_adj`.
2. **Networking (CNI)**:

   * Runtime calls the CNI plugin’s `ADD` for the sandbox → creates a veth pair, connects to the node bridge or overlay, assigns Pod IP (via IPAM), sets routes.
   * NetworkPolicy rules programmed (iptables or eBPF). Pod now has a stable **cluster‑routable IP**.
3. **Volumes (CSI & local)**:

   * **PVCs**: If using PersistentVolumeClaims, the CSI **controller** may have attached the volume; the **node plugin** stages & publishes (mounts) it.
   * **ConfigMap/Secret/DownwardAPI/Projected** volumes are materialized on the node (tmpfs) and mounted into the sandbox.
   * `subPath`, `readOnly`, fsGroup, access modes are applied.
4. **Images**:

   * For each container image, kubelet asks the CRI **ImageService** to pull if needed (policy `Always/IfNotPresent/Never`). Uses `imagePullSecrets`/registry creds.
5. **Init containers** run **sequentially** until all succeed.
6. **App containers** start **in parallel** (unless `startupProbe` gates).

   * Env assembled (literal, from Secret/ConfigMap, Downward API), command/args expanded, working dir set.
   * Lifecycle hooks: `postStart` executed after process start.

Pod phase transitions: **Pending → ContainerCreating → Running** (assuming probes pass).

---

## 5) Probes, readiness, and Service wiring

* **startupProbe** (optional): gating long bootstrap times; until it succeeds, liveness/readiness are disabled.
* **livenessProbe**: failing → kubelet restarts the container.
* **readinessProbe**: failing → container remains running, but **Endpoints/EndpointSlices** will **exclude** this Pod from Service load‑balancing.
* **kube‑proxy** (or CNI dataplane) programs **Service VIPs** (ClusterIP/NodePort/IPVS) and selects **ready** endpoints.
* **Ingress/LoadBalancer** (if used): cloud‑controller provisions external LB; traffic flows to nodes → Service → Pod.

Result: once readiness is **True**, cluster traffic can reach your Pod via Services.

---

## 6) Observability of the lifecycle

Typical **Events** you’ll see (view with `kubectl describe pod <name>`):

* *Created* (by ReplicaSet) → *Scheduled* (by scheduler) → *Pulling* image → *Pulled* → *Created* container → *Started* container → *(Probes)*.

Useful commands:

* `kubectl get deploy,rs,pods -o wide` (owner chain, node placement)
* `kubectl describe pod <pod>` (events, conditions, volumes)
* `kubectl logs <pod> [-c <container>]` (app logs)
* `kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp`
* `kubectl get endpointslices,endpoints svc/<service>` (readiness wiring)

---

## 7) Pod termination (for completeness)

1. You delete the Pod (or scale down a Deployment). API server sets `deletionTimestamp`.
2. **Endpoints** remove the Pod (stops new traffic).
3. **kubelet** sends **SIGTERM** to each container and waits **`terminationGracePeriodSeconds`**.

   * `preStop` hooks run here.
   * After the grace period, kubelet sends **SIGKILL**.
4. Volumes unmounted; CNI `DEL` tears down networking; sandbox removed.
5. Final status pushed to the API (phase `Succeeded`/`Failed`) and object is garbage‑collected (respecting finalizers if any).

---

## 8) Key mechanics & nuances (often asked in interviews)

* **Desired vs Observed state**: Controllers and kubelet continuously reconcile; the cluster self‑heals to the declared spec.
* **QoS & cgroups**: Resource `requests` drive scheduling; `limits` + requests determine QoS classes and cgroup settings; OOM killer honors QoS.
* **Eviction manager**: On resource pressure (memory/disk/inodes), kubelet evicts lower‑priority/best‑effort pods to keep the node healthy.
* **Taints/Tolerations** and **(anti)affinity**: Coarse vs fine‑grained placement controls; topology spread keeps replicas across zones/racks.
* **Admission evolution**: PodSecurityPolicy (deprecated) replaced by **Pod Security Admission** (baseline/restricted/profiles) + ecosystem policies (Kyverno/Gatekeeper).
* **RuntimeClass**: Choose alternative runtimes (gVisor/kata) for stronger isolation; may affect scheduling & overhead.
* **OwnerReferences & GC**: Pods created by RS/Job carry owners; when owners go away, dependents are garbage‑collected.
* **EndpointSlice over Endpoints**: Scales better; kube‑proxy consumes slices for programming dataplane.

## 9) Minimal end‑to‑end timeline (annotated)

```text
kubectl → apiserver → authn → authz → admission (mutate/validate) → etcd (persist)
               ↓
     controllers reconcile (Deployment → ReplicaSet → Pod)
               ↓
         scheduler filters/scores/binds (sets nodeName)
               ↓
  kubelet sees bound Pod → create sandbox → CNI add (IP) → CSI mount → pull images
               ↓
          run init containers → run app containers → probes OK
               ↓
       kube-proxy/Service picks endpoints → traffic flows
```

---

## 10) Managed clusters (EKS/GKE/AKS) specifics

* **Control plane** often hidden and auto‑scaled; version and API features still standard.
* **LoadBalancers/Ingress**: created by controllers talking to your cloud; for EKS, Service type=LB plus **AWS Load Balancer Controller** handles ALB/NLB.
* **Storage**: CSI drivers (EBS, Filestore, Azure Disk) handle dynamic provisioning; `StorageClass` chooses reclaim/policy and parameters.
* **Identity**: EKS commonly uses **IRSA** (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) for Pod‑level AWS permissions projected via tokens.

---

## 11) Where failures usually occur (and what they mean)

* **Rejected at admission**: policy blocks (security context, hostPath, privilege). Fix spec or policy.
* **`Pending` forever**: scheduler can’t place (insufficient CPU/mem, taints, affinity conflicts, PVC not bound).
* **`ImagePullBackOff`**: bad image ref/registry auth; check `imagePullSecrets` and tag.
* **`CreateContainerError`**: bad command/volume mount/permission; see container logs & events.
* **Probes failing**: container restarts or excluded from traffic; verify paths, ports, timeouts.
* **`CrashLoopBackOff`**: app crashes; add `startupProbe`/tune `restartPolicy` or fix app.

---

## 12) Mental model TL;DR

* Kubernetes is a **declarative state machine**. You write *what*; controllers/kubelet figure out *how*.
* Pod creation is a **pipeline**: API accept → persist → reconcile → schedule → realize on node → become ready → receive traffic.

---

### Appendix A — Glossary

* **Pod**: Smallest deployable unit; one or more containers sharing network & (optionally) PID/IPC namespaces and volumes.
* **ReplicaSet/Deployment**: Higher‑level controllers that create/manage Pods.
* **Service**: Stable virtual IP & DNS for discovering reachable **ready** Pods.
* **EndpointSlice**: Records of which Pod IP\:port backs a Service.
* **CNI/CSI**: Plugin interfaces for networking/storage.
* **Probe**: Health checks (startup/liveness/readiness).
* **Taint/Toleration**: Node marks that repel Pods unless they tolerate.
* **Affinity/Anti‑affinity**: Placement constraints among Pods and Nodes.

---

## Want practice?

* Create a small Deployment with an initContainer + readiness probe + PVC. Watch events: `kubectl get events -A --watch`.
* Break things on purpose (wrong image tag, missing toleration) and observe the **exact** stage that fails—then map it back to the pipeline above.

The explanations for all four scenarios are generally correct. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the internal workings of each scenario to provide a clearer understanding.

***

### Q1. Two containers in the same Pod

Your description is accurate. Containers within the same Pod share the same **network namespace**. This shared namespace means they have the same network stack, including the same IP address and network interfaces (e.g., `eth0` or `eth1`). They can communicate with each other using `localhost` (127.0.0.1) because they are essentially on the same host from a networking perspective. This inter-container communication is highly efficient as it's a direct loopback, not involving any complex networking components like CNI plugins or `kube-proxy`.

***

### Q2. Two Pods on the same Node

Your explanation is correct. When two Pods on the same Node communicate, their traffic is handled by the **Container Bridge** (CBR) or `cbr0`. When a Pod is created, the CNI plugin creates a virtual Ethernet pair (**veth pair**). One end of the veth pair is placed inside the Pod's network namespace (often as `eth0`), and the other end is connected to the Node's CBR switch.  When Pod A sends a packet to Pod B's IP, the packet travels from Pod A's `eth0` through its veth pair, onto the CBR switch, and then out through Pod B's veth pair to its `eth0`. The CNI plugin's role is primarily for the **setup** of this connection, not the data path. `kube-proxy` is not involved because the communication is direct between Pods, not through a Service IP.

***

### Q3. Two Pods on different Nodes

Your description of inter-node communication is correct. This is where the CNI plugin's active role in the data path becomes apparent.

* **Overlay Networks (e.g., Flannel VXLAN):** These plugins create a virtual network that spans across all nodes. When Pod A on Node 1 sends a packet to Pod B on Node 2, the packet first goes from Pod A's `eth0` to Node 1's CBR switch. The CNI plugin on Node 1 then **encapsulates** the packet (e.g., in a VXLAN header) and sends it over the physical network to Node 2.  On Node 2, the CNI plugin receives the encapsulated packet, **decapsulates** it, and forwards the original packet to Node 2's CBR switch, which then delivers it to Pod B. This method creates a virtual tunnel, making the Pod network appear flat across all nodes.
* **Routing Protocols (e.g., Calico BGP):** These plugins use a routing-based approach. The CNI plugin on each node advertises the IP addresses of the Pods running on it to other nodes using a protocol like **BGP**. When Pod A on Node 1 sends a packet to Pod B on Node 2, the packet reaches Node 1's CBR switch. The routing table (populated by the CNI plugin) on Node 1 directs the packet to the correct destination Node 2's IP. The packet is then routed directly over the physical network to Node 2, where its CBR switch delivers it to Pod B. This approach avoids encapsulation and is often more performant.

***

### Q4. Service across Nodes

Your summary is correct, highlighting the crucial role of `kube-proxy`.

* **Service IP to Pod IP:** When a Pod sends traffic to a **Service IP**, `kube-proxy` (which runs on every Node) intercepts this traffic. It uses **iptables** or **IPVS** rules to perform **Destination Network Address Translation (DNAT)**. These rules are pre-configured by `kube-proxy` to change the destination IP from the Service IP to the IP of one of the backend Pods.
* **Packet Delivery:** After the DNAT, the packet's new destination is a Pod IP, not a Service IP. The rest of the delivery then follows the same logic as the previous scenarios:
    * If the backend Pod is on the same Node, the packet is delivered directly via the **CBR switch** (like Q2).
    * If the backend Pod is on a different Node, the packet is handled by the **CNI plugin** (overlay or routing) for inter-node delivery before reaching its destination (like Q3).

The key takeaway is that `kube-proxy` is a **control plane component** that sets up the routing rules, and the actual data path is then handled by the CNI plugin and the CBR switch.
