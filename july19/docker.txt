DOCKER - 
->isolated system where products can be run irrespective of the environment/machine
-> lightweight containers with all the dependencies to run a project
-> adv :
docker is faster than vm
portable

-> docker uses docker engines
-> apt install docker.io (installation in linux)
->docker  images : like packets of data which can be run on any OS , when dockers are run these images are actaully run
* build a docker image 

================================
4 things - Docker,Container,Volumes,Networking
What is Docker ? 
# VM : mimics a physical machine
# multiple vms can be run on a single machine
* Docker container will make u feel s if ur using a VM 
containers: if it fits into a container it ships
ZDO = Zero Down 

for example if there is a python application created by a developer and he sends it to Q/A along with the PYTHON and other dependencies required for the application to run.
This can be carried till production

to create a Container- first create an image
from one image we can create any number of containers
(for linux distributions only) as they interact with the kernel
? can a dcoker image created in linux can be used in windows/mac 
ans: WSL 

Docker is designed to work with linux

* containers are create from local images (can be pulled from remote)
* client contacted the daemon
* daemon pulls the required image from Docker HUb
* to see stopped conatiners : docker ps -a

as containers have no OS they are stopped when there are no processes running (?)
stops running : when docker run ubuntu (?)
doesnt stop when running : 
 docker run -it ubuntu bash
 docker run ubuntu ps -ef
 
 -it : interactive and terminal access
 
 port forwarding?
 
 =============================================================
 
 COMMANDS :

1.docker run hello-world 
-> docker runs a container using the image named hello-world
-> Docker Client sends request to Docker Daemon
-> Docker Daemon pulled hello-world image from Docker Hub (if needed)
-> A new container was created from the image
-> The container ran a small program that printed the welcome message
-> Output was streamed back to your terminal

What is a Docker Image?
A Docker image is like a blueprint or template.
It is:
-> A read-only file that contains everything needed to run a program:
-> OS libraries
-> Code
-> Dependencies
-> Configurations
-> Used to create containers.
Think of it like a recipe for a dish.

What is a Docker Container?
A container is a running instance of an image.
It is:
-> Like a virtual machine but much lighter.
-> Isolated, but shares the same kernel as the host OS.
-> Temporary by default (it can be configured to persist).
-> Think of it like a cooked dish from the recipe.

notes: 
Nginx is a very popular open-source web server.
It's used to serve websites, APIs, and files, and it's often used as a reverse proxy.
The Nginx organization provides a ready-made Docker image on Docker Hub.
2️⃣ What happened when you pulled and ran the image?
🔸 docker pull nginx
➡️ Downloaded a pre-built Docker image from Docker Hub.
This image comes with Nginx pre-installed and configured to serve a default page.
🔸 docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my-web nginx
➡️ Ran that image inside a Docker container.
➡️ Exposed its internal port 80 (where Nginx listens) to your VM’s port 8080.


DOCKER VOLUMES:

Container will crash - at some cases(find?)
so they are ephemeral

so we should assume that a conatiner might crash easily-hence design it in such a way - say , stateless
