docker - attached mode

172.17.0.1 - conatiner ip  - docker inspect <>

docker is just a process,, but how can you execute something inside it?


ps -ef - shows all the processes running


conatiner itself is a process.. all the processes inside a conatiner is also executing inside the host. so if we kill something from host also killed in conatiner
